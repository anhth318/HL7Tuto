This is my code for demos of HL7 standards. I build it in basing on the code of Saravanan Subramanian, a researcher on HL7, DICOM and other standards for HIS.


1. shorttutorial package
This package is very simple, you can run it without any additional library. 
The goal is just bulding simple client and server for practizing socket programming.

2. create package
You have to add the library HAPI into the project to run this package.
These libraries are located in 2 folders lib and src inside the folder hapi-dist-2.2-all.
